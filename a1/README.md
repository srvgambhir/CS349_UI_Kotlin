# A1 Notes

Sarvesh Gambhir (s3gambhi 20841905)

## Setup
* Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
* IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1 (Community Edition)
* kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
* Java SDK 17.0.4

## Enhancement 
I added extra sorting options
* Most recent: sorts by most recently added notes
* Least recent: sorts by least recently added notes
* These options are available in the "Order By" menu bar

## Additional Note
I used the JavaFX generator when creating the new project. Therefore my source code is in the following file:

/src/main/kotlin/com/example/basic/HelloApplication.kt
