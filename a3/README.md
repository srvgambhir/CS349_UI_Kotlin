# A3 Connect Four

Sarvesh Gambhir (s3gambhi 20841905)

## Setup
* Ubuntu 22.04.1 LTS
* IntelliJ IDEA 2022.2.1 (Community Edition)
* kotlin.jvm 1.7.10
* Java SDK 17.0.4
* JavaFX version 17.0.2

## Enhancement/Bonus
I added a "Game Reset" functionality:
- At the bottom left of the screen, there is a "Reset" button
- Pressing it removes all tokens and brings the game to a fresh replayable state


## Additional Note
My UI source code is split into three separate class files: View.kt, Piece.kt, PlayerLabel.kt

These files are stored in the following folder: /src/main/kotlin/ui/assignments/connectfour/ui
